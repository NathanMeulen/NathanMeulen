- Hi, my name is Nathan Meulenbroek and I'm a PhD Student in Biomedical Engineering. I have Bachelor’s degrees in computer science and physics and I love multidisciplinary research, data science, and generally nerdy stuff. I'm currently interested in applying my technical knowledge to medicine by integrating multiaxial transducers into medical ultrasound imaging systems, as well as developing associated image reconstruction algorithms.
- I'd be interested in collaborating on related research, image reconstruction work, or just generally cool data science or physics tools.
- You can find more information about me, samples of my work, and contact information at <a href="https://nathanmeulen.github.io">nathanmeulen.github.io</a>.
